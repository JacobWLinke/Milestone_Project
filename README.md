# Duelisting: a Secure Yu-Gi-Oh! Deck Architechture app
Instead of using insecure browser tabs and fragmented lists to hone the perfect Yu-Gi-Oh! deck, Duelisting provides a secure, real-time web application that allows players to structure their decks with privacy and catalogue their wins with accuracy. Duelisting isn't just a simple list of cards, it is a fully authenticated, private vault where players can construct, analyze, and securely store their competitive deck builds.
Duelisting ensures that a player's proprietary strategies remain confidential and protected from unauthorized access until they are ready to be unveiled in play. It provides a clean, interface for searching the card library, building decks up to the 60-card limit, and maintaining strict version history, all while adhering to the principle of least privilege in its user and data management. Duelisting is the secure foundation for competitive duelists to architect their wins.
